A comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents that took place in the United Kingdom year 2020
is provided in this report. Utilizing the aid of a comprehensive data set that includes both
documented and reported traffic events, the paper seeks to carry out two main goals:
• It looks to answer questions about the common conditions leading to accidents, the
trends in accidents over time, and the distribution of accidents across different regions.
• It also displays the results of machine learning models designed to forecast the
probability that an accident will result in a fatality.
